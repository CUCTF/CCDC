SETUID (Set user ID upon execution)
allows non-root users to execute as root.

Check for SETUID outside of bin and sbin

Find SETUID locations
sudo find / -perm -4000

Find binaries that are specifically SETUID root
sudo find / -user root -perm -4000

remove access
sudo chmod o= <filename>

SUID (saved user ID)
is used when a program with privileges needs to do something as non-root

remove access
sudo chmod o= <filename>
