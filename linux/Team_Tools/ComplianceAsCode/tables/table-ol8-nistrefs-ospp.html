<td>Limit the Number of Concurrent Login Sessions Allowed Per User</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit risks related to Denial of
Service attacks. This addresses concurrent sessions for a single account and does not address
concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple accounts. To set the number of concurrent
sessions per user add the following line in <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code> or
a file under <code>/etc/security/limits.d/</code>:
<pre>* hard maxlogins <xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_max_concurrent_login_sessions"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Limiting simultaneous user logins can insulate the system from denial of service
problems caused by excessive logins. Automated login processes operating improperly or
maliciously may result in an exceptional number of simultaneous login sessions.</td>

<td>Set Password Minimum Length in login.defs</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify password length requirements for new accounts, edit the file
<code>/etc/login.defs</code> and add or correct the following line:
<pre>PASS_MIN_LEN <xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>
<br><br>
The DoD requirement is <code>15</code>. 
The FISMA requirement is <code>12</code>.
The profile requirement is
<code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.
If a program consults <code>/etc/login.defs</code> and also another PAM module
(such as <code>pam_pwquality</code>) during a password change operation, then
the most restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section for more
information about enforcing password quality requirements.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Requiring a minimum password length makes password
cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger
search space. However, any security benefit from an onerous requirement
must be carefully weighed against usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive
behavior that may result.</td>

<td>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Digit Characters</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The pam_pwquality module's <code>dcredit</code> parameter controls requirements for
usage of digits in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
contain that many digits. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
length credit for each digit. Modify the <code>dcredit</code> setting in
<code>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</code> to require the use of a digit in passwords.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.
<br><br>
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
