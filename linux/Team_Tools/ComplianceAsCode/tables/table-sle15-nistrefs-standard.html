<td>Limit the Number of Concurrent Login Sessions Allowed Per User</td>

Service attacks. This addresses concurrent sessions for a single account and does not address
concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple accounts. To set the number of concurrent
sessions per user add the following line in <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code> or
a file under <code>/etc/security/limits.d/</code>:

If a program consults <code>/etc/login.defs</code> and also another PAM module
(such as <code>pam_pwquality</code>) during a password change operation, then
the most restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section for more
information about enforcing password quality requirements.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Requiring a minimum password length makes password
cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger

behavior that may result.</td>

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
