<td>The application server must limit the number of concurrent sessions to an organization-defined number for all accounts and/or account types.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Application management includes the ability to control the number of sessions that utilize an application by all accounts and/or account types. Limiting the number of allowed sessions is helpful in limiting risks related to Denial of Service attacks.

Application servers host and expose business logic and application processes.

The application server must possess the capability to limit the maximum number of concurrent sessions in a manner that affects the entire application server or on an individual application basis.

Although there is some latitude concerning the settings themselves, the settings should follow DoD-recommended values, but the settings should be configurable to allow for future DoD direction.

While the DoD will specify recommended values, the values can be adjusted to accommodate the operational requirement of a given system.</td>

If cryptography is not used, then the session data traversing the remote connection could be intercepted and compromised. 

Types of management interfaces utilized by an application server include web-based HTTPS interfaces as well as command line-based management interfaces.</td>

<td>Encryption is critical for protection of remote access sessions. If encryption is not being used for integrity, malicious users may gain the ability to modify the application server configuration. The use of cryptography for ensuring integrity of remote access sessions mitigates that risk.

Application servers utilize a web management interface and scripted commands when allowing remote access. Web access requires the use of TLS and scripted access requires using ssh or some other form of approved cryptography. Application servers must have a capability to enable a secure remote admin capability.

FIPS 140-2 approved TLS versions include TLS V1.0 or greater.

FIPS 140-2 approved TLS versions must be enabled and non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled.

NIST SP 800-52 specifies the preferred configurations for government systems.</td>

(i) users are accessing a U.S. Government information system; 
(ii) system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; 
(iii) unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and 
(iv) the use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording.

System use notification messages can be implemented in the form of warning banners displayed when individuals log on to the information system. 

System use notification is intended only for information system access including an interactive logon interface with a human user, and is not required when an interactive interface does not exist. 

Use this banner for desktops, laptops, and other devices accommodating banners of 1300 characters. The banner shall be implemented as a click-through banner at logon (to the extent permitted by the operating system), meaning it prevents further activity on the information system unless and until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating "OK".

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.
By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:
-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.
-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

It is, therefore, imperative that access to log tools be controlled and protected from unauthorized modification. If an attacker were to delete log tools, the application server administrator would have no way of managing or viewing the logs. 

Application servers provide a web- and/or a command line-based management functionality for managing the application server log capabilities. In addition, subsets of log tool components may be stored on the file system as jar, class or xml configuration files. The application server must ensure that in addition to protecting any web-based log tools, any file system-based tools are protected from unauthorized deletion as well.</td>

<td>If log data were to become compromised, then competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. In addition, access to log records provides information an attacker could potentially use to his or her advantage.

Application servers contain admin interfaces that allow reading and manipulation of log records. Therefore, these interfaces should not allow unfettered access to those records.  Application servers also write log data to log files which are stored on the OS, so appropriate file permissions must also be used to restrict access.

Log information includes all information (e.g., log records, log settings, transaction logs and log reports) needed to successfully log information system activity.  Application servers must protect log information from unauthorized modification.</td>

<td></td>
<td>Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an application server.  Alternative physical protection measures include protected distribution systems.

In order to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of the information, application servers must protect data at rest by using cryptographic mechanisms.

Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).</td>

<td></td>
<td>Security flaws with software applications are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes) to production systems after thorough testing of the patches within a lab environment. Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.</td>

<td>The application server must behave in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an applications data entry field and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

Application servers must ensure their management interfaces perform data input validation checks.  When invalid data is entered, the application server must behave in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.  An example of a predictable behavior is trapping the data, logging the invalid data for forensic analysis if necessary, and continuing operation in a safe and secure manner.</td>

<td>The application server must identify potentially security-relevant error conditions.</td>
<td></td>
<td>The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team.  Any application providing too much information in error logs and in administrative messages to the screen risks compromising the data and security of the application and system.  The extent to which the application server is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Adequate logging levels and system performance capabilities need to be balanced with data protection requirements.

The structure and content of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization and development team.

Application servers must have the capability to log at various levels which can provide log entries for potential security-related error events.

An example is the capability for the application server to assign a criticality level to a failed logon attempt error message, a security-related error message being of a higher criticality.</td>
