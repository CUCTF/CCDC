A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change. If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.

The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:

Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
