<td>Set Account Expiration Following Inactivity</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify the number of days after a password expires (which
signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct
the following lines in <code>/etc/default/useradd</code>, substituting
<code><i>NUM_DAYS</i></code> appropriately:
<pre>INACTIVE=<i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></pre>
A value of 35 is recommended; however, this profile expects that the value is set to
<code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.
If a password is currently on the
verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95
days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the
<code>useradd</code> man page for more information.  Determining the inactivity
timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal"
period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting
the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact
availability of the system to legitimate users.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not
have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers
who may have compromised their credentials.</td>

A value of 180 days is sufficient for many environments.
The DoD requirement is 60.

<td xml:lang="en-US">Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
operating system passwords could be compromised.
<br><br>
Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
location subject to physical compromise.</td>

A value of 1 day is considered sufficient for many
environments. The DoD requirement is 1.

<td xml:lang="en-US">Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password
changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If
users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password,
then the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to
defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse.
<br><br>
Setting the minimum password age protects against users cycling back to a
favorite password after satisfying the password reuse requirement.</td>

their UID changed.

If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite, then

Alternatively, the key may be pre-loaded during the RHEL installation. In

<pre>sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release</pre>
