multifactor/certificate-based authentication mechanisms when using network
access to the management interface.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Multifactor authentication creates a layered defense and makes it more
difficult for an unauthorized person to access the application server. If one
factor is compromised or broken, the attacker still has at least one more
barrier to breach before successfully breaking into the target. Unlike a simple
username/password scenario where the attacker could gain access by knowing both
the username and password without the user knowing his account was compromised,
multifactor authentication adds the requirement that the attacker must have
something from the user, such as a token, or to biometrically be the user.
Multifactor authentication is defined as: using two or more factors to achieve
authentication.
<br><br>
Factors include:
(i) something a user knows (e.g.,
password/PIN);
(ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification
device, token); or
(iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric). A CAC or PKI
Hardware Token meets this definition.

A privileged account is defined as an
information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. These
accounts would be capable of accessing the web management interface.

<td xml:lang="en-US">JBoss logs by default are written to the local file system. A centralized
logging solution like syslog should be used whenever possible; however, any log
