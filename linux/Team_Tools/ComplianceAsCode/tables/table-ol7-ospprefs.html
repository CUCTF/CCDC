<br>-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
<br>-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private,

The SSHD service is by default configured to modify its configuration based on currently configured Crypto-Policy. However, in certain cases it might be needed to override the Crypto Policy specific to OpenSSH Server and leave rest of the Crypto Policy intact.
This can be done by dropping a file named <code>opensshserver-xxx.config</code>, replacing <code>xxx</code> with arbitrary identifier, into <code>/etc/crypto-policies/local.d</code>. This has to be followed by running <code>update-crypto-policies</code> so that changes are applied.

In this case it is file named <code>02-ospp.conf</code> containing parameters which need to be changed with respect to the crypto policy.
This rule checks if the file exists and if it contains required parameters and values which modify the Crypto Policy.
During the parsing process, as soon as Openssh client parses some configuration option and its value, it remembers it and ignores any subsequent overrides. The customization mechanism provided by crypto policies appends eventual customizations at the end of the system wide crypto policy. Therefore, if the crypto policy customization overrides some parameter which is already configured in the system wide crypto policy, the SSH client will not honor that customized parameter.</td>
