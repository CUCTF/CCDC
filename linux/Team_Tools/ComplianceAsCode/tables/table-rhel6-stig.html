For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during

Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

By default, the <code>Anaconda</code> installer uses <code>aes-xts-plain64</code> cipher

To configure the system to prevent the <code>usb-storage</code>
kernel module from being loaded, add the following line to a file in the directory <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code>:
<pre>install usb-storage /bin/true</pre>
This will prevent the <code>modprobe</code> program from loading the <code>usb-storage</code>
module, but will not prevent an administrator (or another program) from using the
<code>insmod</code> program to load the module manually.</td>

can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is required, it may be
possible to configure filesystem mounts statically by editing <code>/etc/fstab</code>
rather than relying on the automounter.
