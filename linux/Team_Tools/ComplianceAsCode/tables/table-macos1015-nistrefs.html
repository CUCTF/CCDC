<td xml:lang="en-US">The audit service should shut down the computer if it 
is unable to audit system events. Once audit failure
occurs, user and system activity is no longer recorded
and malicious activity could go undetected. Audit
processing failures include software/hardware errors,
failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit
storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses
to audit failure depend on the nature of the failure
mode.</td>
