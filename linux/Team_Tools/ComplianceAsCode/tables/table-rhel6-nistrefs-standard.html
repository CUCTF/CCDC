<td>Set Password Maximum Age</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify password maximum age for new accounts,
edit the file <code>/etc/login.defs</code>
and add or correct the following line:
<pre>PASS_MAX_DAYS <xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>
A value of 180 days is sufficient for many environments.
The DoD requirement is 60.
The profile requirement is <code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
operating system passwords could be compromised.
<br><br>
Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
location subject to physical compromise.</td>

A value of 1 day is considered sufficient for many
environments. The DoD requirement is 1.

<td xml:lang="en-US">Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password
changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If
users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password,
then the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to
defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse.
<br><br>
Setting the minimum password age protects against users cycling back to a
favorite password after satisfying the password reuse requirement.</td>

If a program consults <code>/etc/login.defs</code> and also another PAM module
(such as <code>pam_pwquality</code>) during a password change operation, then
the most restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section for more
information about enforcing password quality requirements.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Requiring a minimum password length makes password

<td xml:lang="en-US">ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent
execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as
a limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be
executed, on a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process's memory
regions such as the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware
prevents execution in that address range. This is enabled by default on the
latest Red Hat and Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.</td>
