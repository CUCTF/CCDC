monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law
enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
<br>-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
<br>-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private,
are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be
disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.
<br>-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access
controls) to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or
privacy.

<td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Oracle Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
By default, the <code>Anaconda</code> installer uses <code>aes-xts-plain64</code> cipher
with a minimum <code>512</code> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Oracle Linux 8 Documentation web site:<br>
