<td>Set the GNOME3 Login Warning Banner Text</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">In the default graphical environment, configuring the login warning banner text
in the GNOME Display Manager's login screen can be configured on the login
screen by setting <code>banner-message-text</code> to <code>'<i>APPROVED_BANNER</i>'</code>
where <i>APPROVED_BANNER</i> is the approved banner for your environment.
<br><br>
To enable, add or edit <code>banner-message-text</code> to

<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-text='<i>APPROVED_BANNER</i>'</pre>
Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
<code>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</code> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/banner-message-text</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <code>dconf update</code>.
When entering a warning banner that spans several lines, remember
to begin and end the string with <code>'</code> and use <code>\n</code> for new lines.</td>

<td xml:lang="en-US">The audit system should collect detailed unauthorized file
accesses for all users and root.
To correctly identify unsuccessful creation, unsuccessful modification and unsuccessful access
of files via <code>open_by_handle_at</code> syscall the audit rules collecting these events need to be in certain order.
The more specific rules need to come before the less specific rules. The reason for that is that more
specific rules cover a subset of events covered in the less specific rules, thus, they need to come
before to not be overshadowed by less specific rules, which match a bigger set of events.
Make sure that rules for unsuccessful calls of <code>open_by_handle_at</code> syscall are in the order shown below.
If the <code>auditd</code> daemon is configured to use the <code>augenrules</code>

<td xml:lang="en-US">Oracle Linux 7 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
By default, the <code>Anaconda</code> installer uses <code>aes-xts-plain64</code> cipher
with a minimum <code>512</code> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Oracle Linux 7 Documentation web site:<br>

necessary to support essential organizational operations.
Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from
a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk
over limiting the services provided by any one component.
