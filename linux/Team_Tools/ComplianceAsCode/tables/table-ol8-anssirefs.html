verified by ensuring that the following
line appears:
<pre>Protocol 2</pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">SSH protocol version 1 is an insecure implementation of the SSH protocol and
has many well-known vulnerability exploits. Exploits of the SSH daemon could provide
immediate root access to the system.</td>

<td xml:lang="en-US">The inet-based telnet daemon should be uninstalled.</td>

empty passwords, add or correct the following line in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:
<br>
<pre>PermitEmptyPasswords no</pre>
<br>
Any accounts with empty passwords should be disabled immediately, and PAM configuration
should prevent users from being able to assign themselves empty passwords.</td>

that remote login via SSH will require a password, even in the event of
misconfiguration elsewhere.</td>

<td>Install the ntp service</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The ntpd service should be installed.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Time synchronization (using NTP) is required by almost all network and administrative tasks (syslog, cryptographic based services (authentication, etc.), etc.). Ntpd is regulary maintained and updated, supporting security features such as RFC 5906.</td>

<td>NT012(R03)</td>
<td>Enable the NTP Daemon</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US"> The <code>ntpd</code> service can be enabled with the following command: <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable ntpd.service</pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Enabling the <code>ntpd</code> service ensures that the <code>ntpd</code>
service will be running and that the system will synchronize its time to
any servers specified. This is important whether the system is configured to be
a client (and synchronize only its own clock) or it is also acting as an NTP
server to other systems.  Synchronizing time is essential for authentication
services such as Kerberos, but it is also important for maintaining accurate
logs and auditing possible security breaches.
<br><br>
The NTP daemon offers all of the functionality of <code>ntpdate</code>, which is now
deprecated.  Additional information on this is available at

<td>NT12(R5)</td>
<td>Ensure Logs Sent To Remote Host</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server,
open <code>/etc/rsyslog.conf</code> and read and understand the last section of the file,
which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate remote
logging.
Along with these other directives, the system can be configured
to forward its logs to a particular log server by
adding or correcting one of the following lines,
substituting <code><i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></code> appropriately.
The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system;
although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery,
they may not be supported in all environments.
<br>
To use UDP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* @<i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></pre>

To use RELP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* :omrelp:<i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></pre>
<br>
There must be a resolvable DNS CNAME or Alias record set to "<xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub>" for logs to be sent correctly to the centralized logging utility.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more
systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a
system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages
to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a centralized
place to view the status of multiple hosts within the enterprise.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NT12(R18)</td>
<td>Ensure Logrotate Runs Periodically</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The <code>logrotate</code> utility allows for the automatic rotation of
log files.  The frequency of rotation is specified in <code>/etc/logrotate.conf</code>,
which triggers a cron task.  To configure logrotate to run daily, add or correct
the following line in <code>/etc/logrotate.conf</code>:
<pre># rotate log files <i>frequency</i>
daily</pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Log files that are not properly rotated run the risk of growing so large
that they fill up the /var/log partition. Valuable logging information could be lost
if the /var/log partition becomes full.</td>

<tr>
<td>NT28(R1)</td>
<td>Uninstall Sendmail Package</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Sendmail is not the default mail transfer agent and is
not installed by default.
The <code>sendmail</code> package can be removed with the following command:
<pre>
$ sudo yum erase sendmail</pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The sendmail software was not developed with security in mind and
its design prevents it from being effectively contained by SELinux.  Postfix
should be used instead.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NT28(R4)</td>
<td>Ensure SELinux State is Enforcing</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The SELinux state should be set to <code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_selinux_state"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code> at
system boot time.  In the file <code>/etc/selinux/config</code>, add or correct the
following line to configure the system to boot into enforcing mode:
<pre>SELINUX=<xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_selinux_state"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Setting the SELinux state to enforcing ensures SELinux is able to confine
potentially compromised processes to the security policy, which is designed to
prevent them from causing damage to the system or further elevating their
privileges.</td>

<td>Ensure Users Re-Authenticate for Privilege Escalation - sudo NOPASSWD</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The sudo <code>NOPASSWD</code> tag, when specified, allows a user to execute
commands using sudo without having to authenticate. This should be disabled
by making sure that the <code>NOPASSWD</code> tag does not exist in
<code>/etc/sudoers</code> configuration file or any sudo configuration snippets
in <code>/etc/sudoers.d/</code>.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they
do not have authorization.

is critical that the user re-authenticate.</td>

<td>Configure SELinux Policy</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The SELinux <code>targeted</code> policy is appropriate for
general-purpose desktops and servers, as well as systems in many other roles.
To configure the system to use this policy, add or correct the following line
in <code>/etc/selinux/config</code>:
<pre>SELINUXTYPE=<xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_selinux_policy_name"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>
Other policies, such as <code>mls</code>, provide additional security labeling
and greater confinement but are not compatible with many general-purpose
use cases.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Setting the SELinux policy to <code>targeted</code> or a more specialized policy
ensures the system will confine processes that are likely to be
targeted for exploitation, such as network or system services.
<br><br>
Note: During the development or debugging of SELinux modules, it is common to
temporarily place non-production systems in <code>permissive</code> mode. In such
temporary cases, SELinux policies should be developed, and once work
is completed, the system should be reconfigured to
<code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_selinux_policy_name"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.</td>
