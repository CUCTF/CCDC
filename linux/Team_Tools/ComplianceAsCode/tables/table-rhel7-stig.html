<td>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands match the vendor values.</td>
<td>Permissions on system binaries and configuration files that are too generous
could allow an unauthorized user to gain privileges that they should not have.
The permissions set by the vendor should be maintained. Any deviations from
this baseline should be investigated.</td>
<td>The following command will list which files on the system have permissions different from what
is expected by the RPM database:
$ rpm -Va | awk '{ if (substr($0,2,1)=="M") print $NF }'

<td>The RPM package management system can check file access permissions
of installed software packages, including many that are important
to system security.
Verify that the file permissions of system files
and commands match vendor values. Check the file permissions
with the following command:
<pre>$ sudo rpm -Va | awk '{ if (substr($0,2,1)=="M") print $NF }'</pre>
Output indicates files that do not match vendor defaults.
After locating a file with incorrect permissions,
run the following command to determine which package owns it:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
<br>
Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to
the correct values:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --setperms <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

<td>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor values.</td>
<td>The hashes of important files like system executables should match the
information given by the RPM database. Executables with erroneous hashes could
be a sign of nefarious activity on the system.</td>
<td>The following command will list which files on the system
have file hashes different from what is expected by the RPM database.
$ rpm -Va --noconfig | awk '$1 ~ /..5/ &amp;&amp; $2 != "c"'

<td>Without cryptographic integrity protections, system
executables and files can be altered by unauthorized users without
detection.
The RPM package management system can check the hashes of
installed software packages, including many that are important to system
security.
To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor
values, run the following command to list which files on the system
have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'</pre>
A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change. If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.
Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo yum reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>
Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
<pre>$ sudo rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

<code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.
If a password is currently on the
verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95
days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the
<code>useradd</code> man page for more information.  Determining the inactivity
timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal"
period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting
the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact
availability of the system to legitimate users.</td>
