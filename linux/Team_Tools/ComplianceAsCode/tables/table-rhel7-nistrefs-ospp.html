<td>Limit the Number of Concurrent Login Sessions Allowed Per User</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit risks related to Denial of
Service attacks. This addresses concurrent sessions for a single account and does not address
concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple accounts. To set the number of concurrent
sessions per user add the following line in <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code> or
a file under <code>/etc/security/limits.d/</code>:
<pre>* hard maxlogins <xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_max_concurrent_login_sessions"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>

problems caused by excessive logins. Automated login processes operating improperly or
maliciously may result in an exceptional number of simultaneous login sessions.</td>

If a program consults <code>/etc/login.defs</code> and also another PAM module
(such as <code>pam_pwquality</code>) during a password change operation, then
the most restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section for more
information about enforcing password quality requirements.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Requiring a minimum password length makes password
cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger
search space. However, any security benefit from an onerous requirement
must be carefully weighed against usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive
behavior that may result.</td>

contain that many digits. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
length credit for each digit. Modify the <code>dcredit</code> setting in

to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
