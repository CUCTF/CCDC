# STIGing Standalone Windows Servers

Download all the required files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-Server-STIG-Script)

## Introduction:

Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019 are insecure operating systems out of the box and requires many changes to insure [FISMA](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act) compliance. 
[Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), [Cyber.mil](https://public.cyber.mil), the [Department of Defense](https://dod.gov), and the [National Security Agency](https://www.nsa.gov/) have recommended and required configuration changes to lockdown, harden, and secure the operating system and ensure government compliance. These changes cover a wide range of mitigations including blocking telemetry, macros, removing bloatware, and preventing many physical attacks on a system.

Standalone systems are some of the most difficult and annoying systems to secure. When not automated, they require manual changes of each STIG/SRG. Totalling over 1000 configuration changes on a typical deployment and an average of 5 minutes per change equaling 3.5 days worth of work. This script aims to speed up that process significantly.

## Notes: 

- This script is designed for operation in **Enterprise** environments and assumes you have hardware support for all the requirements.
- This script is not designed to bring a system to 100% compliance, rather it should be used as a stepping stone to complete most, if not all, the configuration changes that can be scripted. 
  - Minus system documentation, this collection should bring you up to about 95% compliance on all the STIGS/SRGs applied.

## Requirements:
- [X] [Standards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure) for a highly secure windows device.
- [X] Bitlocker must be suspended or turned off prior to implementing this script, it can be enabled again after rebooting.
  - Follow-up runs of this script can be run without disabling bitlocker.
- [X] Hardware Requirements
  - [Hardware Requirements for Memory Integrity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/requirements-and-deployment-planning-guidelines-for-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity#baseline-protections)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
Get-ChildItem -Recurse *.ps1 | Unblock-File
.\sos-secure-standalone-server.ps1
```
### Automated Install:
The script may be launched from the extracted GitHub download like this:
```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://simeononsecurity.ch/scripts/standalonewindowsserver.ps1'))
```
