         <string id="Unity_Filter">Unity Filter rule list</string>

         <string id="Unity_Filter_Rules_Desc">This policy specifies the filter rules for window when remoting Hosted Apps. Filter rules are used by the Horizon Agent to support custom applications. This GPO should be used if you have a window display problem, such as a window having a black background or a drop-down window not being sized correctly.

The first step in setting a rule is to determine the characteristics of the window(s) that you want the rule to apply to. There are many possible characteristics that can be identified:

1. Window classname, identified in a custom rule as classname=XYZ
2. Product company, identified as company=XYZ
3. Product name, identified as product=XYZ
4. Product major version, identified as major=XYZ
5. Product minor version, identified as minor=XYZ
6. Product build number, identified as build=XYZ
7. Product revision number, identified as revision=XYZ

It is most common to only use "Window classname" as the preferred characteristic (e.g. classname=CustomClassName). However, the other characteristics are provided in case you need to limit rules to one specific product; you can find these characteristics in the File Properties window of an executable and they must be an exact case-sensitive match, including any special characters. When multiple characteristics are provided, all must match in order for the rule to apply to the window.

Once you have the characteristics identified, the next step is to choose an action. The action must be either action=block or action=map. action=block tells the Horizon Agent to not remote the window to the client. This is used when a window shows up on the client that is too large or interferes with normal window focus behavior. action=map tells the Horizon Agent to treat the window as a certain hardcoded type.

If you set action=map, you also need to specify the type to map the window to. This is done by including type=XYZ. Here is a list of all available type values: normal, panel, dialog, tooltip, splash, toolbar, dock, desktop, widget, combobox, startscreen, sidepanel, taskbar, metrofullscreen, metrodocked.

Here are two examples of rules that you could set to fix a misbehaving application:

1. You can filter out a window that should not be remoted.
   - To block all windows with class name MyClassName, use rule "classname=MyClassName;action=block"
   - To block all windows from product MyProduct, use rule "product=MyProduct;action=block".
2. You can map a window to the correct type. This usually is only necessary if VMware support instructs you to do this, as it is hard to determine if a window is being mapped to the wrong type.
   - To map a custom class to type combo box, use rule "classname=MyClassName;action=map;type=combobox"

Note: This GPO has lower priority than the filtering rules that are installed in %ProgramData%\VMware\RdeServer\Unity Filters</string>

         <string id="Recursive_Domain_Enumeration">Recursive Enumeration of Trusted Domains</string>

         <string id="Recursive_Domain_Enumeration_Desc">Determines if every domain trusted by the domain in which the server resides is enumerated. In order to establish a complete chain of trust, the domains trusted by each trusted domain are also enumerated and the process continues recursively until all trusted domains are discovered. This information is passed to View Connection Server in order to ensure that all trusted domains are available to the client on login.

This property is enabled by default. When disabled, only directly trusted domains are enumerated and connection to remote domain controllers does not take place.

Note: In environments with complex domain relationships — such as those that use multiple forest structures with trust between domains in their forests — this process can take a few minutes to complete.</string>

         <string id="Force_MMR_to_use_overlay">Force MMR to use software overlay</string>

         <string id="Force_MMR_to_use_overlay_Desc">MMR will try to use the hardware overlay to play back video for better performance. However, when working with multiple displays the hardware overlay will only exist on one of the displays: either the primary display or the display where WMP was started. If WMP is dragged to another display the video is shown as a black rectangle. Use this option to force MMR to use a software overlay which will work on all displays.</string>
