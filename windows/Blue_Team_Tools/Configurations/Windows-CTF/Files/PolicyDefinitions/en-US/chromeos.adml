The value must be an array of stringified JSON dictionaries. Each dictionary must have the form { &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;$URL_PATTERN&quot;, &quot;filter&quot; : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts from which client certificates the browser will automatically select. Independent of the filter, only certificates will be selected that match the server's certificate request. For example, if $FILTER has the form { &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }, additionally only client certificates are selected that are issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN. If $FILTER contains an &quot;ISSUER&quot; and a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section, a client certificate must satisfy both conditions to be selected. If $FILTER specifies an organization (&quot;O&quot;), a certificate must have at least one organization which matches the specified value to be selected. If $FILTER specifies an organization unit (&quot;OU&quot;), a certificate must have at least one organization unit which matches the specified value to be selected. If $FILTER is the empty dictionary {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted.

If this policy is left not set, no auto-selection will be done for any site.

Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.

The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site (&quot;requesting URL&quot;) and the URL of the top-level frame site (&quot;embedding URL&quot;) to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the &quot;urls&quot; field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status.

When this policy is set to a non-empty list of time intervals:
Devices will not be able to check for updates automatically during the specified time intervals. Devices that require a rollback or are below the minimum Google Chrome OS version will not be affected by this policy due to potential security issues. Furthermore, this policy will not block update checks requested by users or administrators.
When this policy is unset or contains no time intervals:
No automatic update checks will be blocked by this policy, but they may be blocked by other policies. This feature is only enabled on Chrome devices configured as auto-launch kiosks. Other devices will not be restricted by this policy.

Specifies the prefix of a target version Google Chrome OS should update to. If the device is running a version that's before the specified prefix, it will update to the latest version with the given prefix. If the device is already on a later version, effects depend on the value of DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion. The prefix format works component-wise as is demonstrated in the following example:

&quot;&quot; (or not configured): update to latest version available.
&quot;1412.&quot;: update to any minor version of 1412 (e.g. 1412.24.34 or 1412.60.2)
&quot;1412.2.&quot;: update to any minor version of 1412.2 (e.g. 1412.2.34 or 1412.2.2)
&quot;1412.24.34&quot;: update to this specific version only

Warning: It is not recommended to configure version restrictions as they may prevent users from receiving software updates and critical security fixes. Restricting updates to a specific version prefix might leave users at risk.

Example value: 1412.</string><string id="DeviceUpdateStagingSchedule">The staging schedule for applying a new update</string><string id="DeviceUpdateStagingSchedule_Explain">This policy defines a list of percentages that will define the fraction of Google Chrome OS devices in the OU to update per day starting from the day the update is first discovered. The discovery time is later than the update published time, since it could be a while after the update publishing until the device checks for updates.

Each (day, percentage) pair contains which percentage of the fleet has to be updated by the given number of days since the update has been discovered. For example, if we have the pairs [(4, 40), (10, 70), (15, 100)], then 40% of the fleet should have been updated 4 days after seeing the update. 70% should be updated after 10 days, and so on.

If there is a value defined for this policy, updates will ignore the DeviceUpdateScatterFactor policy and follow this policy instead.

If this list is empty, there will be no staging and updates will be applied according to other device policies.

This policy does not apply for channel switches.

The device may wait a portion of this time in terms of wall-clock-time and the remaining portion in terms of the number of update checks. In any case, the scatter is upper bounded to a constant amount of time so that a device does not ever get stuck waiting to download an update forever.</string><string id="DeviceUpdateAllowedConnectionTypes">Connection types allowed for updates</string><string id="DeviceUpdateAllowedConnectionTypes_Explain">The types of connections that are allowed to use for OS updates. OS updates potentially put heavy strain on the connection due to their size and may incur additional cost. Therefore, they are by default not enabled for connection types that are considered expensive (currently only &quot;cellular&quot;).

     The recognized connection type identifiers are &quot;ethernet&quot;, &quot;wifi&quot;, and &quot;cellular&quot;.

Example value:

This allows transparent HTTP caching of HTTP downloads.

If this policy is set to true, Google Chrome OS will attempt to download auto-update payloads via HTTP. If the policy is set to false or not set, HTTPS will be used for downloading auto-update payloads.</string><string id="RebootAfterUpdate">Automatically reboot after update</string><string id="RebootAfterUpdate_Explain">Schedule an automatic reboot after a Google Chrome OS update has been applied.

When this policy is set to true, an automatic reboot is scheduled when a Google Chrome OS update has been applied and a reboot is required to complete the update process. The reboot is scheduled immediately but may be delayed on the device by up to 24 hours if a user is currently using the device.

When this policy is set to false, no automatic reboot is scheduled after applying a Google Chrome OS update. The update process is completed when the user next reboots the device.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

Note: Currently, automatic reboots are only enabled while the login screen is being shown or a kiosk app session is in progress. This will change in the future and the policy will always apply, regardless of whether a session of any particular type is in progress or not.</string><string id="MinimumRequiredChromeVersion">Configure minimum allowed Chrome version for the device.</string><string id="MinimumRequiredChromeVersion_Explain">Configures the requirement of the minimum allowed version of Google Chrome. Versions below given are treated as obsolete and device would not allow user sign in before OS is updated.
If current version becomes obsolete during user session, user will be forcefully signed out.

If this policy is not set, no restrictions are applied, and user can sign regardless of Google Chrome version.

Here &quot;Version&quot; can be either an exact version like '61.0.3163.120' or a version prefix, like '61.0'

Example value: 61.0.3163.120</string><string id="DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion">Rollback to target version</string><string id="DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion_Explain">Specifies whether the device should roll back to the version set by DeviceTargetVersionPrefix if it's already running a later version.

Try to carry over device-level configuration (including network credentials) through the rollback process, if possible, but do the rollback with full powerwash even if restoring the data is not possible (because the target version doesn't support restoring data or because of a backward-incompatible change).
Supported on Google Chrome OS version 75 and higher. For older clients, this value means that rollback is disabled.</string><string id="DeviceRollbackAllowedMilestones">Number of milestones rollback is allowed</string><string id="DeviceRollbackAllowedMilestones_Explain">Specifies the minimum number of Google Chrome OS milestones rollback should be allowed starting from the stable version at any time.

Default is 0 for consumer, 4 (approx. half a year) for enterprise enrolled devices.

Setting this policy prevents rollback protection to apply for at least this number of milestones.

Setting this policy to a lower value has a permanent effect: the device MAY not be able to roll back to earlier versions even after the policy is reset to a larger value.

Actual rollback possibilities may also depend on the board and critical vulnerability patches.</string><string id="DeviceQuickFixBuildToken">Provide users with Quick Fix Build</string><string id="DeviceQuickFixBuildToken_Explain">This policy controls whether or not the device should be updated to a Quick Fix Build.

If policy value is set to a token that maps to a Quick Fix Build, the device will be updated to the corresponding Quick Fix Build if the update is not blocked by another policy.

If this policy is not set, or if its value does not map to a Quick Fix Build, then the device won't be updated to a Quick Fix Build. If the device is already running a Quick Fix Build and the policy is not set anymore or its value does not map to a Quick Fix Build anymore, then the device will be updated to a regular build if the update is not blocked by another policy.

Example value: sometoken</string><string id="Display_group">Display</string><string id="DeviceDisplayResolution">Set display resolution and scale factor</string><string id="DeviceDisplayResolution_Explain">When this policy is set, resolution and scale factor of each
display are set to the specified values. External display settings are
applied to all connected external displays.

Values of &quot;external_width&quot; and &quot;external_height&quot; should be specified in
pixels. Values of &quot;external_scale_percentage&quot; and
&quot;internal_scale_percentage&quot; should be specified in percents.

If &quot;external_use_native&quot; is set to true, policy will ignore values of
&quot;external_height&quot; and &quot;external_width&quot; and set resolution of the external
displays to their native resolution.

If &quot;external_use_native&quot; is false or not provided and either
&quot;external_height&quot; or &quot;external_width&quot; is not provided, policy doesn't
affect the external display settings. If specified resolution or
scale factor is not supported by some display, policy is not applied to
that display.

If &quot;recommended&quot; flag is set to true, users may change resolution and
scale factor of any display via the settings page after logging in, but
their settings will be overriden by the policy value at the next reboot.
If &quot;recommended&quot; flag is set to false or not set, users can't change the
display settings.

specified orientation on every reboot, and the first time it is connected
after the policy value has changed. Users may change the display
rotation via the settings page after logging in, but their
setting will be overridden by the policy value at the next reboot.

This policy applies to both the primary and all secondary displays.

free to change it. In this case, the default value is not reapplied at
restart.</string><string id="DisplayRotationDefault_ROTATE_0">Rotate screen by 0 degrees</string><string id="DisplayRotationDefault_ROTATE_90">Rotate screen clockwise by 90 degrees</string><string id="DisplayRotationDefault_ROTATE_180">Rotate screen by 180 degrees</string><string id="DisplayRotationDefault_ROTATE_270">Rotate screen clockwise by 270 degrees</string><string id="Extensions_group">Extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlacklist">Configure extension installation blacklist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlacklist_Explain">Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blacklisted, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blacklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blacklist value of '*' means all extensions are blacklisted unless they are explicitly listed in the whitelist.

If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Google Chrome.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlacklistDesc">Configure extension installation blacklist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelist">Configure extension installation whitelist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelist_Explain">Allows you to specify which extensions are not subject to the blacklist.

A blacklist value of * means all extensions are blacklisted and users can only install extensions listed in the whitelist.

By default, all extensions are whitelisted, but if all extensions have been blacklisted by policy, the whitelist can be used to override that policy.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelistDesc">Configure extension installation whitelist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist_Explain">Specifies a list of apps and extensions that are installed silently,
without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled nor
disabled by the user. All permissions requested by the
apps/extensions are granted implicitly, without user interaction,
including any additional permissions requested by future versions of
the app/extension. Furthermore, permissions are granted for the
enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension
APIs. (These two APIs are not available to apps/extensions that are
not force-installed.)

This policy takes precedence over a potentially conflicting ExtensionInstallBlacklist policy. If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by Google Chrome.

For Windows instances that are not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

Note that the source code of any extension may be altered by users via Developer Tools (potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional). If this is a concern, the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy should be set.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on chrome://extensions when in developer mode. The &quot;update&quot; URL, if specified, should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is &quot;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx&quot;). Note that the &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest. Note also that specifying the &quot;update&quot; URL explicitly was mandatory in Google Chrome versions up to and including 67.

For example, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx installs the extension with id aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa from the standard Chrome Web Store &quot;update&quot; URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting.

If this policy is left not set, no apps or extensions are installed automatically and the user can uninstall any app or extension in Google Chrome.

Note that this policy doesn't apply to incognito mode.

Example value:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx
abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelistDesc">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources_Explain">Allows you to specify which URLs are allowed to install extensions, apps, and themes.

Starting in Google Chrome 21, it is more difficult to install extensions, apps, and user scripts from outside the Chrome Web Store. Previously, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and Google Chrome would offer to install the file after a few warnings. After Google Chrome 21, such files must be downloaded and dragged onto the Google Chrome settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users will be able to easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (i.e. the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

ExtensionInstallBlacklist takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blacklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.

Example value:

https://corp.mycompany.com/*</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSourcesDesc">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes">Configure allowed app/extension types</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes_Explain">Controls which app/extension types are allowed to be installed and limits runtime access.

This setting white-lists the allowed types of extension/apps that can be installed in Google Chrome and which hosts they can interact with. The value is a list of strings, each of which should be one of the following: &quot;extension&quot;, &quot;theme&quot;, &quot;user_script&quot;, &quot;hosted_app&quot;, &quot;legacy_packaged_app&quot;, &quot;platform_app&quot;. See the Google Chrome extensions documentation for more information on these types.

Note that this policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed via ExtensionInstallForcelist.

If this setting is configured, extensions/apps which have a type that is not on the list will not be installed.

If this settings is left not-configured, no restrictions on the acceptable extension/app types are enforced.

Prior to version 75 using multiple comma separated extension IDs is not supported and will be skipped. The rest of the policy will continue to apply.

Example value:

hosted_app</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypesDesc">Configure allowed app/extension types</string><string id="ExtensionSettings">Extension management settings</string><string id="ExtensionSettings_Explain">Configures extension management settings for Google Chrome.

This policy controls multiple settings, including settings controlled by any existing extension-related policies. This policy will override any legacy policies if both are set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its configuration. With an extension ID, configuration will be applied to the specified extension only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID &quot;*&quot;, which will apply to all extensions that don't have a custom configuration set in this policy. With an update URL, configuration will be applied to all extensions with the exact update URL stated in manifest of this extension, as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate.

For Windows instances that are not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

|old_configs| should be used for validating access code only when it cannot be validated with |future_config| nor |current_config|.

The expected way of using this policy is to gradually rotate access code configuration. New configuration is always put into |future_config| and at the same

Usage restrictions can be applied to the apps installed on Google Chrome OS for the given user.
Restrictions should be passed in |app_limits| list. Only one entry per-app is allowed. Apps not included in the list have no restrictions.
It is not possible to block apps that are essential for the operating system, the restrictions for such apps will be ignored.
App is uniquely identified by |app_id|. Since different types of apps can use different id format |app_type| needs to be specified next to |app_id|.
Per-App Time Limits only support |ARC| apps currently. Android package name is used as |app_id|.
Support for other types of applications will be added in the future, for now they can be specified in the policy, but the restrictions will take no effect.
There are two types of available restrictions: |BLOCK| and |TIME_LIMIT|.
|BLOCK| makes app unavailable for the user. If |daily_limit_mins| is specified with |BLOCK| restriction |daily_limit_mins| will be ignored.
|TIME_LIMITS| applies daily usage limit and makes app unavailable after the limit is reached on the given day. Usage limit is specified in |daily_limit_mins|. Usage limit is reset daily at the UTC time passed in |reset_at|.
This policy is only used for child users.
This policy is complementary to 'UsageTimeLimit'. Restrictions specified in 'UsageTimeLimit' like screen time and bedtime will be enforced regardless of 'PerAppTimeLimits'.

The |time_window_limit| specifies a daily window in which the user's session should be locked. We only support one rule for each day of the week, therefore the |entries| array may vary from 0-7 in size. |starts_at| and |ends_at| are the beginning and the end of the window limit, when |ends_at| is smaller than |starts_at| it means that the |time_limit_window| ends on the following day. |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked. There is a property for each day of the week, and it should be set only if there is an active quota for that day. |usage_quota_mins| is the amount of time that the managed device can be use in a day and |reset_at| is the time when the usage quota is renewed. The default value for |reset_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

|overrides| is provided to invalidate temporarily one or more of the previous rules.
* If neither time_window_limit nor time_usage_limit is active |LOCK| can be used to lock the device.
* |LOCK| temporarily locks a user session until the next time_window_limit or time_usage_limit starts.
* |UNLOCK| unlocks a user's session locked by time_window_limit or time_usage_limit.
|created_time_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the override creation, it is sent as a String because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer It is used to determine whether this override should still be applied. If the current active time limit feature (time usage limit or time window limit) started after the override was created, it should not take action. Also if the override was created before the last change of the active time_window_limit or time_usage_window it should not be applied.

Multiple overrides may be sent, the newest valid entry is the one that is going to be applied.

* The screen will be turned off if the user remains idle for the time specified by |ScreenOff|.
* A warning dialog will be shown if the user remains idle for the time specified by |IdleWarning|, telling the user that the idle action is about to be taken. The warning message is only shown if the idle action is to logout or shut down.
* The action specified by |IdleAction| will be taken if the user remains idle for the time specified by |Idle|.

For each of above actions, the delay should be specified in milliseconds, and needs to be set to a value greater than zero to trigger the corresponding action. In case the delay is set to zero, Google Chrome OS will not take the corresponding action.

For each of the above delays, when the length of time is unset, a default value will be used.

Note that |ScreenDim| values will be clamped to be less than or equal to |ScreenOff|, |ScreenOff| and |IdleWarning| will be clamped to be less than or equal to |Idle|.

|IdleAction| can be one of four possible actions:
* |Suspend|
* |Logout|
* |Shutdown|

When the length of time is set to a value greater than zero, it represents the length of time that the user must remain idle before Google Chrome OS locks the screen.

When the length of time is set to zero, Google Chrome OS does not lock the screen when the user becomes idle.

When the length of time is unset, a default length of time is used.

The recommended way to lock the screen on idle is to enable screen locking on suspend and have Google Chrome OS suspend after the idle delay. This policy should only be used when screen locking should occur a significant amount of time sooner than suspend or when suspend on idle is not desired at all.

The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to be less than the idle delay.

Peak Shift is power saving policy that minimizes alternating current usage during the peak usage times during the day. For each weekday a start and end time to run in power Peak Shift mode can be set. During these times the system will run from the battery even if the alternating current is attached as long as the battery stays above the threshold specified. After the end time specified the system will run from alternating current if attached but will not charge the battery. The system will again function normally using alternating current and recharging the battery after the specified Charge Start time.

When this policy is unset or set to Default (value 0), the behavior of SAML logins is determined by the browser depending on other factors. In the most basic scenario, the user authentication and the protection of the cached user data are based on passwords manually entered by users.

When this policy is set to ClientCertificate (value 1), client certificate authentication is used for newly added users which log in via SAML. No passwords are used for such users, and their cached local data is protected using corresponding cryptographic keys.

Note that, for security and privacy reasons, extensions are not allowed to be installed using this policy. Moreover, the devices on the Stable channel will only install the apps that belong to the whitelist bundled into Google Chrome. Any items that don't conform to these conditions will be ignored.

If an app that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by Google Chrome.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on chrome://extensions when in developer mode. The &quot;update&quot; URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate. Note that the &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest.

For example, gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx installs the Chrome Remote Desktop app from the standard Chrome Web Store &quot;update&quot; URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting.

The value must be an array of stringified JSON dictionaries. Each dictionary must have the form '{ &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;$URL_PATTERN&quot;, &quot;filter&quot; : $FILTER }', where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts from which client certificates the browser will automatically select. Independent of the filter, only certificates will be selected that match the server's certificate request. If $FILTER has the form '{ &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }', additionally only client certificates are selected that are issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the &quot;/&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is &quot;sha256&quot;.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default one or more operating systems supported by Google Chrome, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or Google Chrome OS.

A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

Each item in the list must contain both devices and urls in order for the policy to be valid. Each item in devices can contain a vendor ID and product ID field. Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.

The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site (&quot;requesting URL&quot;) and the URL of the top-level frame site (&quot;embedding URL&quot;) to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the &quot;urls&quot; field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in &quot;urls&quot; must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.

If this policy is left not set, the global default value will be used for all sites (no automatic access).

This policy affects all types of storage media. For example: USB flash drives, external hard drives, SD and other memory cards, optical storage etc. Internal storage is not affected, therefore files saved in the Download folder can still be accessed. Google Drive is also not affected by this policy.

If this policy is set to true or not not configured, the user, apps and extensions with appropriate permissions can enter fullscreen mode.

If this policy is set to false, neither the user nor any apps or extensions can enter fullscreen mode.

On all platforms except Google Chrome OS, kiosk mode is unavailable when fullscreen mode is disabled.</string><string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled">Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache</string><string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled_Explain">This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

If this policy is unset or disabled, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site, so if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If the policy is enabled, HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures, and will be removed in the future.</string><string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList">List of names that will bypass the HSTS policy check</string><string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList_Explain">Hostnames specified in this list will be exempt from the HSTS policy check that could potentially upgrade requests from http to https.

Keys are designated for corporate usage if they're generated using the chrome.enterprise.platformKeys API on a managed account. Keys imported or generated in another way are not designated for corporate usage.

Access to keys designated for corporate usage is solely controlled by this policy. The user can neither grant nor withdraw access to corporate keys to or from extensions.

By default an extension cannot use a key designated for corporate usage, which is equivalent to setting allowCorporateKeyUsage to false for that extension.

Only if allowCorporateKeyUsage is set to true for an extension, it can use any platform key marked for corporate usage to sign arbitrary data. This permission should only be granted if the extension is trusted to secure access to the key against attackers.

</string><string id="ManagedBookmarks">Managed Bookmarks</string><string id="ManagedBookmarks_Explain">Configures a list of managed bookmarks.

The policy consists of a list of bookmarks whereas each bookmark is a dictionary containing the keys &quot;name&quot; and &quot;url&quot; which hold the bookmark's name and its target. A subfolder may be configured by defining a bookmark without an &quot;url&quot; key but with an additional &quot;children&quot; key which itself contains a list of bookmarks as defined above (some of which may be folders again). Google Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted via the Omnibox, for example &quot;google.com&quot; becomes &quot;https://google.com/&quot;.

These bookmarks are placed in a folder that can't be modified by the user (but the user can choose to hide it from the bookmark bar). By default the folder name is &quot;Managed bookmarks&quot; but it can be customized by adding to the list of bookmarks a dictionary containing the key &quot;toplevel_name&quot; with the desired folder name as the value.

Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and can't be modified by extensions.

When launched, the app will be able to create an app window on top of the lock screen, and create data items (notes) in the lock screen context. The app will be able to import created notes to the primary user session, when the session is unlocked. Currently, only Chrome note-taking apps are supported on the lock screen.

If the policy is set, the user will be allowed to enable an app on the lock screen only if the app's extension ID is contained in the policy list value.
As a consequence, setting this policy to an empty list will disable note-taking on the lock screen entirely.
Note that the policy containing an app ID does not necessarily mean that the user will be able to enable the app as a note-taking app on the lock screen - for example, on Chrome 61, the set of available apps is additionally restricted by the platform.

If the policy is left unset, there will be no restrictions on the set of apps the user can enable on the lock screen imposed by the policy.

The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such
as &quot;*.example.com&quot;) for which security restrictions on insecure origins
will not apply.

The intent is to allow organizations to set whitelist origins for legacy
applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for
internal web development so that their developers can test out features
requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labeled
&quot;Not Secure&quot; in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will
override the command-line flag.

This policy will override UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

Any values not in this range will be clamped to the respective boundary. If the platform supports policy notifications, the refresh delay will be set to 24 hours because it is expected that policy notifications will force a refresh automatically whenever policy changes.

Leaving this policy not set will make Google Chrome use the default value of 3 hours.

Note that if the platform supports policy notifications, the refresh delay will be set to 24 hours (ignoring all defaults and the value of this policy) because it is expected that policy notifications will force a refresh automatically whenever policy changes, making more frequent refreshes unnecessary.</string><string id="PromptForDownloadLocation">Ask where to save each file before downloading</string><string id="PromptForDownloadLocation_Explain">

Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. For Google Chrome OS devices, a restart notification appears in the system tray according to the RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod policy. For Google Chrome browsers, the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the RelaunchNotification policy follow this same schedule.

If this policy is not set, the current UI locale will be pre-selected.

If this policy is set, the recommended locales will be moved to the top of the list and will be visually separated from all other locales. The recommended locales will be listed in the order in which they appear in the policy. The first recommended locale will be pre-selected.

If there is more than one recommended locale, it is assumed that users will want to select among these locales. Locale and keyboard layout selection will be prominently offered when starting a managed session. Otherwise, it is assumed that most users will want to use the pre-selected locale. Locale and keyboard layout selection will be less prominently offered when starting a managed session.

When this policy is set and automatic login is enabled (see the |DeviceLocalAccountAutoLoginId| and |DeviceLocalAccountAutoLoginDelay| policies), the automatically started managed session will use the first recommended locale and the most popular keyboard layout matching this locale.

The pre-selected keyboard layout will always be the most popular layout matching the pre-selected locale.

If the policy is set to false, autoupgrades will be disabled for audio and video, and no warning will be shown for images.
This policy does not affect other types of mixed content other than audio, video, and images.</string><string id="SuppressUnsupportedOSWarning">Suppress the unsupported OS warning</string><string id="SuppressUnsupportedOSWarning_Explain">Suppresses the warning that appears when Google Chrome is running on a computer or operating system that is no longer supported.

If this policy is false or unset, the warnings will appear on such unsupported computers or operating systems.</string><string id="SyncDisabled">Disable synchronization of data with Google</string><string id="SyncDisabled_Explain">Disables data synchronization in Google Chrome using Google-hosted synchronization services and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you enable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Google Chrome.

If this policy is left not set Google Sync will be available for the user to choose whether to use it or not.

To fully disable Google Sync, it is recommended that you disable the Google Sync service in the Google Admin console.

This policy should not be enabled when RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy is set to enabled as that feature shares the same client side functionality. The Google-hosted synchronization is disabled in this case completely.</string><string id="SyncTypesListDisabled">List of types that should be excluded from synchronization</string><string id="SyncTypesListDisabled_Explain">If this policy is set all specified data types will be excluded from syncronzation both for Google Sync as well as for roaming profile synchronization. This can be beneficial to reduce the size of the roaming profile or limit the type of data uploaded to the Google Sync Servers.

The current data types for this policy are: &quot;bookmarks&quot;, &quot;preferences&quot;, &quot;passwords&quot;, &quot;autofill&quot;, &quot;themes&quot;, &quot;typedUrls&quot;, &quot;extensions&quot;, &quot;apps&quot;, &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;wifiConfiguration&quot;. Those names are case sensitive!

Example value:

bookmarks</string><string id="SyncTypesListDisabledDesc">List of types that should be excluded from synchronization</string><string id="TLS13HardeningForLocalAnchorsEnabled">Enable a TLS 1.3 security feature for local trust anchors.</string><string id="TLS13HardeningForLocalAnchorsEnabled_Explain">This policy controls a security feature in TLS 1.3 which protects connections against downgrade attacks. It is backwards-compatible and will not affect connections to compliant TLS 1.2 servers or proxies. However, older versions of some TLS-intercepting proxies have an implementation flaw which causes them to be incompatible.

If this policy is set to True, Google Chrome will enable these security protections for all connections.

If this policy is set to False or not set, Google Chrome will disable these security protections for connections authenticated with locally-installed CA certificates. These protections are always enabled for connections authenticated with publicly-trusted CA certificates.

This policy may be used to test for any affected proxies and upgrade them. Affected proxies are expected to fail connections with an error code of ERR_TLS13_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED. A later version of Google Chrome will enable this option by default.

After it is enabled by default, administrators who need more time to upgrade affected proxies may use this policy to temporarily disable this security feature. This policy will be removed after version 85.
</string><string id="TabFreezingEnabled">Allow background tabs freeze</string><string id="TabFreezingEnabled_Explain">Controls whether Google Chrome can freeze tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes.

If the policy is set to true, tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes may be frozen. Tab freezing reduces CPU, battery and memory usage. Google Chrome uses heuristics to avoid freezing tabs that do useful work in the background (e.g. display notifications, play sound, stream video). Web developers can also opt-out their site from freezing (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/chrome/browser/performance_manager/docs/freezing_opt_out_opt_in.md).

If the policy is set to false, no tabs will be frozen.</string><string id="TaskManagerEndProcessEnabled">Enable ending processes in Task Manager</string><string id="TaskManagerEndProcessEnabled_Explain">If set to false, the 'End process' button is disabled in the Task Manager.

If set to true or not configured, the user can end processes in the Task Manager.</string><string id="TermsOfServiceURL">Set the Terms of Service for a device-local account</string><string id="TermsOfServiceURL_Explain">Sets the Terms of Service that the user must accept before starting a device-local account session.

If this policy is set, Google Chrome OS will download the Terms of Service and present them to the user whenever a device-local account session is starting. The user will only be allowed into the session after accepting the Terms of Service.

If this policy is not set, no Terms of Service are shown.

The policy should be set to a URL from which Google Chrome OS can download the Terms of Service. The Terms of Service must be plain text, served as MIME type text/plain. No markup is allowed.

Example value: https://www.example.com/terms_of_service.txt</string><string id="TouchVirtualKeyboardEnabled">Enable virtual keyboard</string><string id="TouchVirtualKeyboardEnabled_Explain">This policy configures enabling the virtual keyboard as an input device on ChromeOS. Users cannot override this policy.

If the policy is set to true, the on-screen virtual keyboard will always be enabled.

If set to false, the on-screen virtual keyboard will always be disabled.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it. However, users will still be able to enable/disable an accessibility on-screen keyboard which takes precedence over the virtual keyboard controlled by this policy. See the |VirtualKeyboardEnabled| policy for controlling the accessibility on-screen keyboard.

If this policy is left unset, the on-screen keyboard is disabled initially but can be enabled by the user anytime. Heuristic rules may also be used to decide when to display the keyboard.</string><string id="TranslateEnabled">Enable Translate</string><string id="TranslateEnabled_Explain">Enables the integrated Google Translate service on Google Chrome.

If you enable this setting, Google Chrome will offer translation functionality to the user by showing an integrated translate toolbar (when appropriate) and a translate option on the right-click context menu.

If you disable this setting, all built-in translate features will be disabled.

If you enable or disable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Google Chrome.

If this setting is left not set the user can decide to use this function or not.</string><string id="URLBlacklist">Block access to a list of URLs</string><string id="URLBlacklist_Explain">This policy prevents the user from loading web pages from blacklisted URLs. The blacklist provides a list of URL patterns that specify which URLs will be blacklisted.

A URL pattern has to be formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format.

Exceptions can be defined in the URL whitelist policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

Note that it is not recommended to block internal 'chrome://*' URLs since this may lead to unexpected errors.

From M73 you can block 'javascript://*' URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript typed in address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). Note that in-page JavaScript URLs, as long as dynamically loaded data, are not subject to this policy. For example, if you block 'example.com/abc', page 'example.com' will still be able to load 'example.com/abc' via XMLHTTPRequest.

If this policy is not set no URL will be blacklisted in the browser.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/bad_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com
file://*
custom_scheme:*
*</string><string id="URLBlacklistDesc">Block access to a list of URLs</string><string id="URLWhitelist">Allow access to a list of URLs</string><string id="URLWhitelist_Explain">Allows access to the listed URLs, as exceptions to the URL blacklist.

See the description of the URL blacklist policy for the format of entries of this list.

This policy can be used to open exceptions to restrictive blacklists. For example, '*' can be blacklisted to block all requests, and this policy can be used to allow access to a limited list of URLs. It can be used to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths.

The most specific filter will determine if a URL is blocked or allowed. The whitelist takes precedence over the blacklist.

This policy is limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

If this policy is not set there will be no exceptions to the blacklist from the 'URLBlacklist' policy.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/good_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com</string><string id="URLWhitelistDesc">Allow access to a list of URLs</string><string id="UnifiedDesktopEnabledByDefault">Make Unified Desktop available and turn on by default</string><string id="UnifiedDesktopEnabledByDefault_Explain">If this policy is set to true, Unified Desktop is allowed and
enabled by default, which allows applications to span multiple displays.
The user may disable Unified Desktop for individual displays by unchecking
it in the display settings.

If this policy is set to false or unset, Unified Desktop will be
disabled. In this case, the user cannot enable the feature.</string><string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled">Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection</string><string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled_Explain">Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection in Google Chrome and prevents users from changing this setting.

URL-keyed anonymized data collection sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better.

If you enable this policy, URL-keyed anonymized data collection is always active.

If you disable this policy, URL-keyed anonymized data collection is never active.

If this policy is left not set, URL-keyed anonymized data collection will be enabled but the user will be able to change it.</string><string id="UserAvatarImage">User avatar image</string><string id="UserAvatarImage_Explain">This policy allows you to configure the avatar image representing the user on the login screen. The policy is set by specifying the URL from which Google Chrome OS can download the avatar image and a cryptographic hash used to verify the integrity of the download. The image must be in JPEG format, its size must not exceed 512kB. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.

The avatar image is downloaded and cached. It will be re-downloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes.

If this policy is set, Google Chrome OS will download and use the avatar image.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

If the policy is left not set, the user can choose the avatar image representing them on the login screen.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=UserAvatarImage for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value:

If this policy is set, the login screen will use the specified string in the picture-based login chooser for the corresponding device-local account.

If the policy is left not set, Google Chrome OS will use the device-local account's email account ID as the display name on the login screen.

This policy is ignored for regular user accounts.

Example value: Policy User</string><string id="UserFeedbackAllowed">Allow user feedback</string><string id="UserFeedbackAllowed_Explain">Allow user feedback.
If the policy is set to false, users can not send feedback to Google.

If the policy is unset or set to true, users can send feedback to Google via Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;Report an Issue or key combination.</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowed">Allow or deny video capture</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowed_Explain">If enabled or not configured (default), the user will be prompted for
video capture access except for URLs configured in the
VideoCaptureAllowedUrls list which will be granted access without prompting.

When this policy is disabled, the user will never be prompted and video
capture only be available to URLs configured in VideoCaptureAllowedUrls.

This policy affects all types of video inputs and not only the built-in camera.</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls">URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain">Patterns in this list will be matched against the security
origin of the requesting URL.  If a match is found, access to video
capture devices will be granted without prompt.

NOTE: Until version 45, this policy was only supported in Kiosk mode.

Example value:

https://[*.]example.edu/</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrlsDesc">URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string><string id="VpnConfigAllowed">Allow the user to manage VPN connections</string><string id="VpnConfigAllowed_Explain">Allow the user to manage VPN connections.

If this policy is set to false, all Google Chrome OS user interfaces that would allow the user to disconnect or modify VPN connections are disabled.

If this policy is unset or set to true, users can disconnect or modify VPN connections as usual.

If the VPN connection is created via a VPN app, the UI inside the app remains unaffected by this policy. Therefore, the user might still be able to use the app to modify the VPN connection.

This policy is meant to be used together with the &quot;Always on VPN&quot; feature, that lets the admin decide to establish a VPN connection on boot.</string><string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled">Enable WPAD optimization</string><string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled_Explain">Allows to turn off WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) optimization in Google Chrome.

If this policy is set to false, WPAD optimization is disabled causing Google Chrome to wait longer for DNS-based WPAD servers.  If the policy is not set or is enabled, WPAD optimization is enabled.

Independent of whether or how this policy is set, the WPAD optimization setting cannot be changed by users.</string><string id="WallpaperImage">Wallpaper image</string><string id="WallpaperImage_Explain">This policy allows you to configure the wallpaper image that is shown on the desktop and on the login screen background for the user. The policy is set by specifying the URL from which Google Chrome OS can download the wallpaper image and a cryptographic hash used to verify the integrity of the download. The image must be in JPEG format, its file size must not exceed 16MB. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.

The wallpaper image is downloaded and cached. It will be re-downloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes.

If this policy is set, Google Chrome OS will download and use the wallpaper image.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

If the policy is left not set, the user can choose an image to be shown on the desktop and on the login screen background.

Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member: &quot;url&quot; and two optional members: &quot;default_launch_container&quot; and &quot;create_desktop_shortcut&quot;. &quot;url&quot; should be the URL of the web app to install, &quot;launch_container&quot; should be either &quot;window&quot; or &quot;tab&quot; to indicate how the Web App will be opened once installed, and &quot;create_desktop_shortcut&quot; should be true if a desktop shortcut should be created on Linux and Windows. If &quot;default_launch_container&quot; is omitted, the app will open in a tab by default. Regardless of the value of &quot;default_launch_container&quot;, users are able to change which container the app will open in. If &quot;create_desktop_shortcuts&quot; is omitted, no desktop shortcuts will be created. See PinnedLauncherApps policy for pinning apps to the ChromeOS shelf.

This policy allows these features to be selectively re-enabled until M84.

     If this policy is set to True, the Web Components v0 features will be enabled for all sites.

     If this policy is set to False or not set, the Web Components v0 features will be disabled by default, starting in M80.

     This policy will be removed after Chrome 84.</string><string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed">Allow collection of WebRTC event logs from Google services</string><string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed_Explain">
If the policy is set to true, Google Chrome is allowed to collect WebRTC event logs from Google services (e.g. Google Meet), and upload those logs to Google.

If the policy is set to false, Google Chrome may not collect nor upload such logs.

If the policy is unset, up to and including M76, Google Chrome may not collect nor upload such logs.

If the policy is unset, since M77, Google Chrome may collect or upload such logs by default if the browser profile is considered managed, i.e. if the profile receives cloud or machine level policies, and is not a child, ephemeral, login, or incognito profile.

These logs contain diagnostic information helpful when debugging issues with audio or video calls in Chrome, such as the time and size of sent and received RTP packets, feedback about congestion on the network, and metadata about time and quality of audio and video frames. These logs do not contain audio or video contents from the call.

This data collection by Chrome can only be triggered by Google's web services, such as Google Hangouts or Google Meet.

Google may associate these logs, by means of a session ID, with other logs collected by the Google service itself; this is intended to make debugging easier.
