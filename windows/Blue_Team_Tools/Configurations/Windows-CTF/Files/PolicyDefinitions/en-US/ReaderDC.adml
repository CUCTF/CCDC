      <string id="EnhancedSecurityStandalone">Enhanced Security: standalone mode</string>
      <string id="EnhancedSecurityStandalone_Explain">The Enhanced Security feature is designed to limit document behaviors in workflows where those behaviors are perceived as a vulnerability or security risk. Enhanced Security blocks 6 specific behaviors: data injection, script injection, silent printing, web links (if not allowed by Trust Manager settings), cross domain access, and access to external streams. Standalone mode occurs when Adobe Reader is running as an application. Enhanced Security is enabled by default. Configuring this setting to Enabled or Disabled prevents users from changing it from the administrator's desired configuration. Not Configured and Enabled have the same behavior of enabling Enhanced Security but users can change the value when it is set to Not Configured.</string>
