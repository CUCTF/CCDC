<#
.SYNOPSIS  
    This script will monitor creations, deletions, changes, and renames that take place within a directory. The monitoring covers any sub-directories and 
    files as well. Any hits will be written to the screen and to a log called FileChangeLog.txt in the directory from which the script is ran from. 

.USAGE
    Change the path to the directory you wish to monitor on the second line below with the variable "$watcher.Path" and run the script. An ignorelist can be read 
    by the script as well and will read it from the current directory. It should be named "ignorelist.txt" an there should be one entry per line.
