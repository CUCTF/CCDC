# The block list automatically applies to all zones for which the server is authoritative. For example, if the DNS server is authoritative for contoso.com and for europe.contoso.com, it ignores queries for wpad.contoso.com as well as for wpad.europe.contoso.com. However, the DNS Server service does not ignore queries for names in zones for which it is not authoritative. 

<# Identify the items in the list. If you want to add more to the list, take note of the items currently listed and as adding more will overwrite the current ones listed. With that said, you will need to add the current ones listed with the additional ones you want to add. To add to the list, use the following syntax:
	dnscmd /config /globalqueryblocklist WKGA1023, wpad, isatap

dnscmd /info /globalqueryblocklist | out-file .\Blocked_items.txt

# Determines if the blocklist is enabled or not. "1" = enabled, "0" = disabled
dnscmd /info /enableglobalqueryblocklist | out-file .\Blocklist_status.txt

# Gets DNS information
