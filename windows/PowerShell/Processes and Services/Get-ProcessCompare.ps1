.SYNOPSIS
    Compares two different process list and spits out the difference. 
    
    To get the baseline process list, you would run the following:
            Get-Process | Export-CliXML reference.xml
    
    That will save the current running processes to a file called reference.xml. Utilizing the below script, it will read back in the reference.xml file and compare 
    the difference with the current running processes. The results of those actions will be displayed to the screen depicting the differences.
